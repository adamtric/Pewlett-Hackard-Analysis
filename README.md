# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand the impact that the "Silver Tsunami" will have on the organization. By breaking down the number of people that are retiring in each role, the organization can use this data to understand where to put their focus in order to prepare for this dramatic shift in the labor market.

## Results
* Senior Engineers will have to most open/filled positions of the 7 possible roles at the company (25,916)
* Only 2 Managers are on the verge of retiring and the manager position is the position with the least amount of retirement-ready invidividuals

## Summary

According to the data, the "Silver Tsunami" is sure to make an impact on the organization. With over 72,000 individuals on the verge of retiring, there will be many roles to have filled. Many of these openings will be on the engineering side of the business. The good news, however, is that only 2 managers are on the verge of retirement, leaving the organization with plenty of leadership talent.

With 72,458 individuals seemingly on the way out of the organization soon, only 1,549 of those individuals are eligilble to participate in the Mentorship Program. Even at a 100% participation rate, and assuming that all of the 72,458 positions get filled, the average mentor would be responsible for mentoring about 46 people. There is a large discrepency between the number of program eligible inividuals and new individuals that will be joining the organization. No, there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

There are some other tables we can create to provide added insight into the upcoming "Silver Tsunami". One of these tables would be to understand how many people are retiring under each manager. With this data, we can understand which managers will need the most support and we can understand where best to allocate our mentors to help these managers.

Additionally, we can look at the the list of current employees who are not retiring soon to understand who has been with the organization the longest. Perhaps many of these individuals are due for promotions into more senior level roles, helping to ease the burden of finding more senior individuals in a competitve market.
